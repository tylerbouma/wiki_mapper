# Wiki Mapper
## What I want to do
This project will be an exploration of wikipedia. I want to map the immediate relationships between searched wikipedia pages.

### This will use a python virual environment
*python3 -m venv env*

* User inputs a subject they would like to find a wikipedia page for
* Find the page related to the user's input
* Scrape the originally searched wikipedia page
* Store all links found on the original page to a temporary file
